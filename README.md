# Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for CarRacing-v0

This repository contains an implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for training an agent to play the CarRacing-v0 game from the OpenAI Gym environment. The agent learns to navigate a racing track using a neural network-based policy and value function estimation.
