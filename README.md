# Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for CarRacing-v0

This repository contains an implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for training an agent to play the CarRacing-v0 game from the OpenAI Gym environment. The agent learns to navigate a racing track using a neural network-based policy and value function estimation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Gym
- Argparse

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ppo-car-racing.git
